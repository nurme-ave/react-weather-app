## Overview

### Project Description

This was my React project in which I practiced the React useEffect Hook.

I'm using the Weather API to fetch weather data in useEffect(). I have passed the URL as a second parameter into useEffect() so it runs when the URL has changed.

I also have 2 useState Hooks. One of them tracks the state of the user input and the other one tracks the URL.

New things learned:
- side effects in React
- useEffect() Hook
- using useState() with useEffect()
- setting new data fetched from the API

The page was built first for desktop and then I optimized it for mobile view.

I'm also the author of the design of this page.
